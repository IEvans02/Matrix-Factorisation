# Matrix-Factorisation
 Techniques to factorise different linear systems and matrices.

lslu.m can be used to implement the LU Factorisation method for solving the Least Squares problem for m>n.
Inputs and outputs are described in the code.

lq.m is used to compute the QL factorisation of a general dense matrix A.
